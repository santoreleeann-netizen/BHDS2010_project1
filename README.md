# BHDS2010_project1
Group project with Lee Ann and Jonathan

10/21/25 LAS: Blank r markdown file to get started! 10.21.25

10/28/25 LAS: Here is the script for the main branch that recreates the dataset 
and correctly assigns names and classes to each variable. Now we can start 
adding branches and completing each part on our own time using this as the
basis.

10/29/25 JR: First commit with boxplots added. I included two, and would love 
to know which you like more, and if you think they need anything else!

11/1/25 LAS: Script for bar plot

11/2/25 JR: Added summary statistics!!


11/3/25 LAS: Merge pull request #1 from santoreleeann-netizen/boxplot_branch
11/3/25 LAS: Merge pull request #2 from santoreleeann-netizen/Boxplot
11/3/25 LAS: Just cleaning it up so we do everything in the same color and font
and such. Loved your second box plot so kept that and removed the first one. 
All clean except didn't have time to look at summary stats. Will look at that 
in a few hours and then put into a markdown file for you to review.

11/4/25 LAS: Ok final r markdown file, pdf, and script for our project.
I think this is good to submit, I just need to check on what a read me is
and update that
11/4/25: OK read me is updated. Let me know if good and then I will submit the
final pdf and read.me final (am I forgetting anything else?)
11/4/25 JR: Everything looks great!
